            Hey, Cindy. How are you doing with your ||~new|| business?
Hey, Greg. It's going well. I signed up two new ||~clients|| last week, and now I have five total.
Wow, five already. That's great! How do you like being self-employed?
Oh it's ||~wonderful||. I can work from home, and even from the ||~coffee|| shop. And I can set my
own hours. I did a conference call last week while I was ||~wearing|| my night gown and
bathrobe.
