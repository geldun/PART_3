        Honey, we need to cut our ||~expenses||. I think we should refinance our mortgage. I heard an
ad on the radio today. It said that the ||~interest|| rate right now is only 5 percent.
Hmm... That's a good idea. What's our mortgage ||~payment|| now, about $300 a month?
Yes. I called the phone number on the radio ad. The ||~gentleman|| said we could lower our
payment to about $200 a month if we refinance soon.
Let's make an appointment with the ||~mortgage|| company. We sure could use an extra
hundred bucks each month.
